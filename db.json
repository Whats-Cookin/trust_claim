And the only way to make this happen is by working together. \r\nTony's raises awareness around child labour and forced labour in cocoa, because for change to happen, everyone has to be aware of current problems, possible solutions and the role we each play.\r\nTony's leads by example by being 100% traceable from bean-to-bar, because knowing who produces the beans where and under which circumstances is the only way to take full responsibility. Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\r\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.",

This starts with avoiding companies and industries causing harm, but most importantly is a positive focus on where money is invested. Companies with higher environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics can have a positive impact on our planet and also make better financial investments. Pathfinder’s savings scheme (Pathfinder KiwiSaver Scheme) helps members save for retirement by aligning their ethical beliefs with Pathfinder’s investment expertise. As well as striving for savings to work hard, Pathfinder KiwiSaver's social enterprise approach supports a family of 17 charities doing good in the community. 20% of KiwiSaver management fees are donated to these charities and every KiwiSaver member has a say in how donations are allocated. The mission is to provide long-term and sustainable income streams to charities with impact.\r\n\r\nPathfinder is a UNPRI signatory and an active member of RIAA.",
