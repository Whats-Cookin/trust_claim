# Shadow DOM Conflict Fix

## Issue
After deployment, the application shows errors:
```
Failed to execute 'attachShadow' on 'Element': Shadow root cannot be created on a host which already hosts a shadow tree.
```

## Root Cause
This error typically occurs when:
1. Browser extensions (password managers, ad blockers) inject their own shadow DOM elements
2. Deployment platform (AWS Amplify) injects monitoring/analytics scripts that conflict
3. Multiple attempts to attach shadow roots to the same element

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Shadow DOM Conflict Prevention (index.html)
Added a script that intercepts `attachShadow` calls and prevents duplicate shadow root creation.

### 2. Additional Steps to Try

If the issue persists after deployment:

1. **Check Browser Extensions**
   - Test in incognito/private mode with all extensions disabled
   - Common problematic extensions: LastPass, 1Password, Grammarly, ad blockers

2. **AWS Amplify Specific**
   - Check if Amplify is injecting any monitoring scripts
   - In Amplify Console, go to App settings > Environment variables
   - Add: `AMPLIFY_MONOREPO_APP_ROOT` = `.` (if not already set)

3. **Add CSP Headers** (if needed)
   Create a `customHttp.yml` in your project root:
   ```yaml
   customHeaders:
     - pattern: "**/*"
       headers:
         - key: "Content-Security-Policy"
           value: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';"
   ```

4. **Alternative Fix - Vite Config**
   If the issue is related to build optimization, you can try adding to `vite.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   build: {
     commonjsOptions: {
       transformMixedEsModules: true
     }
   }
   ```

## Testing
1. Build locally: `yarn build`
2. Test production build: `yarn preview`
3. Check browser console for any shadow DOM warnings
4. Test in different browsers and incognito mode

## Prevention
- Regularly test production builds locally
- Monitor for browser extension conflicts
- Keep deployment platform configurations documented
